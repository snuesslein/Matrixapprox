	abstract = {Currently there is a growing interest in semiseparable matrices and generalized semiseparable matrices. To gain an appreciation of the historical evolution of this concept, we present in this paper an extensive list of publications related to the field of semiseparable matrices. It is interesting to see that semiseparable matrices were investigated in different fields, e.g., integral equations, statistics, vibrational analysis, independently of each other. Also notable is the fact that leading statisticians at that time used semiseparable matrices without knowing their inverses to be tridiagonal. During this historical evolution the definition of semiseparable matrices has always been a difficult point leading to misunderstandings; sometimes they were defined as the inverses of irreducible tridiagonal matrices leading to generator representable matrices, while in other cases they were defined as matrices having low rank blocks below the diagonal.},

In this new reference work, Raf Vandebril, Marc Van Barel, and Nicola Mastronardi present the first comprehensive overview of the mathematical and numerical properties of the family's newest member: semiseparable matrices. The text is divided into three parts. The first provides some historical background and introduces concepts and definitions concerning structured rank matrices. The second offers some traditional methods for solving systems of equations involving the basic subclasses of these matrices. The third section discusses structured rank matrices in a broader context, presents algorithms for solving higher-order structured rank matrices, and examines hybrid variants such as block quasiseparable matrices. An accessible case study clearly demonstrates the general topic of each new concept discussed. Many of the routines featured are implemented in Matlab and can be downloaded from the Web for further exploration.},

	abstract = {The modeling of physical properties often leads to the task of solving partial differential equations or integral equations. The results of some discretisation and linearisation process are matrix equations or linear systems of equations with special features. In the case of partial differential equations one exploits the local character of the differentiation by using some finite element method or finite difference scheme and gains a sparse system matrix. In the case of (nonlocal) integral operators low rank approximations seem to be the method of choice. These are either given explicitly by some multipole method or panel clustering technique or implicitly by rank revealing decompositions. Both types of matrices can be represented as so-called H-matrices. In this thesis we investigate algorithms that perform the addition, multiplication and inversion of H-matrices approximately. Under moderate assumptions the complexity of these new arithmetics is almost linear (linear up to logarithmic terms of order 1 to 3). The arithmetic operations can be performed adaptively, that is up to some given accuracy epsilon the relative error of the operations is zero. The question arises under which circumstances the inverse of an H-matrix can be approximated by an H-matrix. For the techniques used in this thesis we need very restrictive assumptions, but the numerical examples in the last part indicate that the approximability does not depend on these assumptions.},

However, the current demand of {DNNs} for computational resources especially the storage consumption is growing due to that the increasing sizes of models are being required for more and more complicated applications. To address this problem, several tensor decomposition methods including tensor-train ({TT}) and tensor-ring ({TR}) have been applied to compress {DNNs} and shown considerable compression effectiveness. In this work, we introduce the hierarchical Tucker ({HT}), a classical but rarely-used tensor decomposition method, to investigate its capability in neural network compression. We convert the weight matrices and convolutional kernels to both {HT} and {TT} formats for comparative study, since the latter is the most widely used decomposition method and the variant of {HT}. We further theoretically and experimentally discover that the {HT} format has better performance on compressing weight matrices, while the {TT} format is more suited for compressing convolutional kernels. Based on this phenomenon we propose a strategy of hybrid tensor decomposition by combining {TT} and {HT} together to compress convolutional and fully connected parts separately and attain better accuracy than only using the {TT} or {HT} format on convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}). Our work illuminates the prospects of hybrid tensor decomposition for neural network compression.},

The method, Optimal Brain Surgeon ({OBS}), is significantly better than magnitude-based methods and Optimal Brain Damage, which often remove the wrong weights. {OBS}, permits pruning of more weights than other methods (for the same error on the training set), and thus yields better generalization on test data.

	shorttitle = {Kaleidoscope},
	abstract = {Modern neural network architectures use structured linear transformations, such as low-rank matrices, sparse matrices, permutations, and the Fourier transform, to improve inference speed and reduce memory usage compared to general linear maps. However, choosing which of the myriad structured transformations to use (and its associated parameterization) is a laborious task that requires trading off speed, space, and accuracy. We consider a different approach: we introduce a family of matrices called kaleidoscope matrices (K-matrices) that provably capture any structured matrix with near-optimal space (parameter) and time (arithmetic operation) complexity. We empirically validate that K-matrices can be automatically learned within end-to-end pipelines to replace hand-crafted procedures, in order to improve model quality. For example, replacing channel shuffles in {ShuffleNet} improves classification accuracy on {ImageNet} by up to 5\%. K-matrices can also simplify hand-engineered pipelines---we replace filter bank feature computation in speech data preprocessing with a learnable kaleidoscope layer, resulting in only 0.4\% loss in accuracy on the {TIMIT} speech recognition task. In addition, K-matrices can capture latent structure in models: for a challenging permuted image classification task, adding a K-matrix to a standard convolutional architecture can enable learning the latent permutation and improve accuracy by over 8 points. We provide a practically efficient implementation of our approach, and use K-matrices in a Transformer network to attain 36\% faster end-to-end inference speed on a language translation task.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate the possibility of what we call sparse learning: accelerated training of deep neural networks that maintain sparse weights throughout training while achieving dense performance levels. We accomplish this by developing sparse momentum, an algorithm which uses exponentially smoothed gradients (momentum) to identify layers and weights which reduce the error efficiently. Sparse momentum redistributes pruned weights across layers according to the mean momentum magnitude of each layer. Within a layer, sparse momentum grows weights according to the momentum magnitude of zero-valued weights. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse performance on {MNIST}, {CIFAR}-10, and {ImageNet}, decreasing the mean error by a relative 8\%, 15\%, and 6\% compared to other sparse algorithms. Furthermore, we show that sparse momentum reliably reproduces dense performance levels while providing up to 5.61x faster training. In our analysis, ablations show that the benefits of momentum redistribution and growth increase with the depth and size of the network. Additionally, we find that sparse momentum is insensitive to the choice of its hyperparameters suggesting that sparse momentum is robust and easy to use.},

	abstract = {Theory and practice of computational linear algebra differ over the issue of degeneracy. Block matrix decompositions are used heavily in theory, but less in practice, since even when a matrix is nondegenerate (has full rank) its block submatrices can be degenerate. The potential degeneracy of block submatrices can completely prevent practical use of block matrix algorithms. Gaussian elimination is an important example of an algorithm affected by the possibility of degeneracy. While the basic elimination procedure is simple to state and implement, it becomes more complicated with the addition of a pivoting procedure, which handles degenerate matrices having zeros on the diagonal. Pivoting can significantly complicate the algorithm, increase data movement, and reduce speed, particularly on high-performance computers. We propose a randomization scheme that preconditions an input matrix by multiplying it with random matrices, where this multiplication can be performed efficiently. At the e...},

	abstract = {A butterfly network consists of logarithmically many layers, each with a linear number of non-zero weights (pre-specified). The fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform ({FJLT}) can be represented as a butterfly network followed by a projection onto a random subset of the coordinates. Moreover, a random matrix based on {FJLT} with high probability approximates the action of any matrix on a vector. Motivated by these facts, we propose to replace a dense linear layer in any neural network by an architecture based on the butterfly network. The proposed architecture significantly improves upon the quadratic number of weights required in a standard dense layer to nearly linear with little compromise in expressibility of the resulting operator. In a collection of wide variety of experiments, including supervised prediction on both the {NLP} and vision data, we show that this not only produces results that match and at times outperform existing well-known architectures, but it also offers faster training and prediction in deployment. To understand the optimization problems posed by neural networks with a butterfly network, we also study the optimization landscape of the encoder-decoder network, where the encoder is replaced by a butterfly network followed by a dense linear layer in smaller dimension. Theoretical result presented in the paper explains why the training speed and outcome are not compromised by our proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Recovering a large low-rank matrix from highly corrupted, incomplete or sparse outlier overwhelmed observations is the crux of various intriguing statistical problems. We explore the power of "greedy bilateral ({GreB})" paradigm in reducing both time and sample complexities for solving these problems. {GreB} models a low-rank variable as a bilateral factorization, and updates the left and right factors in a mutually adaptive and greedy incremental manner. We detail how to model and solve low-rank approximation, matrix completion and robust {PCA} in {GreB}’s paradigm. On their {MATLAB} implementations, approximating a noisy 10000x10000 matrix of rank 500 with {SVD} accuracy takes 6s; {MovieLens}10M matrix of size 69878x10677 can be completed in 10s from 30\% of 10{\textasciicircum}7 ratings with {RMSE} 0.86 on the rest 70\%; the low-rank background and sparse moving outliers in a 120x160 video of 500 frames are accurately separated in 1s. This brings 30 to 100 times acceleration in solving these popular statistical problems.},
